More than 30 years ago in 1986, Norton Commander defined a way of managing files that allowed users to navigate through a crowded hard disk with a breeze. After this, many other file managers followed its path. Nowadays, the most popular file manager from this family is Total Commander on Windows and Midnight Commander on UNIX-based distributions.

Today, the new file manager starts its journey - Cross Commander. The goal of this file manager is to redefine how file managers work, similarly as Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code redefined text editors. Cross Commander is modern, open-source dual-pane file manager with all fancy features - automatic updates, command palette, great customizability, stability, extreme performance, rock-solid security, and many others.

I am looking forward to bring state-of-the-art quality into this field.
