What is the most important feature of a decent file manager? Is it speed? Is it corectness? Is it various functionality? Wrong! Everything depends on the look and feel! :)

When designing a tool that will be used throughout the whole day, its look is definitely important. That's why in Cross Commander you will be able to customize colors based on your favorite applications, your environment, or your current mood.

Custom themes will be available via custom extensions. The colors will be defined in a JSON file. Everyone will be able to create a color theme to their liking.
